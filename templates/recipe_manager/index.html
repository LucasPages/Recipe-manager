        <p>This website as a blog / note app to write down recipes and add notes to them.</p>
        <p>Made by Lucas Pag√®s as a portfolio project using Django and Tailwind CSS.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This website implements <span class="italic">CRUD operations</span> on recipe pages. It's meant to be a notes app more than a food blog.
